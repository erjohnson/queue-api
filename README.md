# Queue API

An API built with [Rails-API](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api) for storing help-tickets to a PostgreSQL database.

The goal of this project is to supplement the [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/) in-class issue tracking system [Queue](https://github.com/dustinbrownman/queue). At the moment, Queue utilizes [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) for storing data & real-time updates.  This API aims to provide a normalized database for Queue in order to run easier queries on data.

This project is a work-in-progress.  Contributions, critiques, or kind words are welcome.
